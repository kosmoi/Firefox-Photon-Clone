This is a tool by @pellaeon [https://github.com/pellaeon], a BIT modyfied by me and with a new installation guide.


# Changes from original

Link to the Original: https://github.com/pellaeon/firefox-91plus-photon-userchrome

In fact, I only have change the size of the single tabs on the top corner.
Mainly, I created this project, that I can find this stuff easily and to create a installation guide. 

The main work (99.9 %) is made by pellaeon!
